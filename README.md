### WELCOME TO LEPTOCODE
![leptocode video](https://github.com/leptocode/leptocode/blob/master/leptovideo.gif?raw=true)
In my spare time, I enjoy building educational iOS apps, which is the product of COVID and an idea I co-designed with my 5-year-old daughter.

I am a firm believer in edge computing. Applied AI will shift to edge devices as self-driving vehicles will make it into the mainstream, revolutionizing the role of the Cloud and the Blockchain. I have hands-on experience with data science models, I now enjoy building mobile apps with embedded machine learning.
