### WELCOME TO LEPTOCODE

iOS development is the product of COVID and an idea I had with my 5 year old daughter
I am a firm believer in edge computing. Applied AI will shift to edge devices as self-driving vehicles will make it into the mainstream. I have hands-on experience with data science models, I now look forward to building mobile apps with applied AI for fun.
